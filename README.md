# Spooncraft Name Link
Links nicknames and name colours with the Mumbo Jumbo Discord server.

**Note: This is not official, nor required for Spooncraft.**

## Features
Spooncraft Name Link displays the nickname and colour of Mumbo Jumbo Discord server members in game.<br>
It replaces Minecraft names with discord nicknames and colours in the server tablist, player nametags, and chat messages.

## Configuration
With [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), you can enable and disable replacing and colouring names in each location (tablist, nametags, and chat).<br>
You can also change the location from where the data is sourced.
This allows you to use it on your own servers. An example of the data format can be seen [here](https://gwaff.uqcloud.net/api/spooncraft).

## Disclaimer
This mod was created for Java 1.21 client-side Fabric.
I will not make a version for Bedrock, Forge, or versions before 1.21.
I may make a server-side version in future depending on demand.<p>
This mod is created primarily for the [Mumbo Jumbo Spooncraft Server](https://discord.gg/mumbo-jumbo-server-377946908783673344), however, it will work for other servers provided you have a json file hosted somewhere.
